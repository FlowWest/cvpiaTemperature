#' Monthly Mean Water Temperature
#' @description A dataset containing the monthly mean water temperature in
#' celsius for each CVPIA watershed 1980-2000.
#'
#' @format dataframe with 7,440 rows and 3 variables
#' \describe{
#'  \item{date}{calendar date, monthly value 1980-2000}
#'  \item{watershed}{CVPIA watershed name}
#'  \item{monthly_mean_temp_c}{modeled monthly mean temperature in °C}
#'  }
#'
#' @details The following four methods were used to estimate the monthly mean water
#' temperature for the watersheds during 1980-2000:
#'
#'
#' \strong{HEC-5Q} \cr
#' Temperature assignments were determined by Mike Wright using the input files
#' for the three HEC-5Q runs, i.e. AR_5QCS.dat and AR_5Q-CL.OUT.
#'
#'
#' \strong{Empirical Data} \cr
#' Only the Lower Sacramento had sufficient measured water temperature during
#' the period of the CVPIA salmon life cycle model. The few missing values were
#' imputed using \href{https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/forecast/versions/8.1/topics/na.interp}{\code{forecast::na.interp}}.
#'
#'  \strong{Double Regression Modeling} \cr
#'  Data from many temperature gauges was collected from several CVPIA watersheds.
#'  In these watersheds, a double regression technique was employed to predict water
#'  temperature based on equilibrium temperature and the river mile of interest.
#'  Equilibrium temperature is the temperature a pool of water would approach if
#'  left in contact with the air for an infinite time, generally equivalent to the
#'  air temperature. The results were applied to both watersheds of origin and as
#'  surrogate data for ungauged watersheds.

#'  \href{https://cvpiatemperature-r-package.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Temperature_Regression_Model_for_CVPIA_Streams.pdf}{Modeling Details}
#'
#' \strong{Additional Temperature Modeling} \cr
#' For streams without major dams, water temperature is highly correlated with air temperature.
#' For each watershed not included in the HEC-5Q model that had partial water temperature data,
#' a linear model was fitted to estimate water temperature as a function of air temperature.
#'
#' Generally, the air temperature record spans both the period of the CVPIA salmon life cycle model
#' and the complete period of record of available water temperature data. In the
#' cases where there were missing air temperature values between 1980-2000, we imputed the missing values using
#' \href{https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/forecast/versions/8.1/topics/na.interp}{\code{forecast::na.interp}}
#' in order to have a complete air temperature dataset for water temperature estimation.
