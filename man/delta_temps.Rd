\description{
Rearing temperature in the North and South Delta
}
\details{
Water temperature in the Delta was modeled as a function of air temperature.

North Delta was modeled using a sample of recent measured water temperature at
CDEC station \href{http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/staMeta?station_id=EMM}{EMM}
and NOAA CDO air temperature data from \href{https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GSOM/stations/GHCND:USC00040232/detail}{Antioch}.

South Delta was modeled using a sample of recent measured water temperature at
CDEC station \href{http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/staMeta?station_id=MTB}{MTB}
and NOAA CDO air temperature data \href{https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GSOM/stations/GHCND:USW00023237/detail}{Stockton Airport}.
